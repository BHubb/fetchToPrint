fetchToPrint, A simple imap/pop attachment printer

fetchToPrint works by grabing mail via fetchmail/procmail, it is then unpacked with munpack (mpack) and then sent to the printer of choice.

# Dependencies
fetchmail
procmail
cups
mpack

# Configure
All configurations should be made in the fetchToPrint.conf file that resides in the same dir as fetchToPrint.sh

$FETCHTOPRINT_DIR is used to set the scripts root dir and needs to be set

Logs can be sent anywhere however fetchToPrint will still make a log folder in $FETCHTOPRINT_DIR 
Note for $PROCMAIL_LOG it is a DIR not a file as the procmail config takes both

$ATTACHMENT_TYPE excludes '.' if you include it you will get *..txt

$MAIL_NEWDIR should include a '*' for the directory where new mail is placed
